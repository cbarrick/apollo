Getting Started
==================================================

Installing Conda
--------------------------------------------------

Conda is a cross-platform, language-agnostic environment and package manager. This guide will use a minimal installer of conda, called Miniconda, to setup a development environment for Apollo.

Our first step is to download the Miniconda3 installer. These can be found online at https://conda.io/miniconda.html. For the rest of this guide, we will assume a 64-bit Linux platform.

Download and execute the latest Miniconda installer::

    wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p miniconda
