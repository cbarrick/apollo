Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

``apollo-logo-master.svg``
    This is the main file from which the others are derived.

``apollo-logo-text-color.svg``
    This version is visually identical to the master version. The wordmark has been converted from text to a path. This enables it to be rendered properly on clients that lack the Fira Sans font but makes editing it more difficult.

``apollo-logo-text-nocolor.svg``
    This version is like ``apollo-logo-text-color.svg`` with the coloring removed.

``apollo-logo-notext-color.svg``
    This version is like ``apollo-logo-text-color.svg`` with the wordmark removed.

``apollo-logo-notext-nocolor.svg``
    This version is like ``apollo-logo-text-color.svg`` with both the coloring and the wordmark removed.
