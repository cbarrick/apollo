  # We are deprecating our use of joblib. Previously, joblib was only used
  # directly for its serialization feature. Starting with Python 3.8, a new
  # pickle protocol (version 5) has been introduced to solve the same problems
  # of the joblib serialization. It has been backported to Python 3.6 as the
  # pickle5 package.
  #
  # Version 1 of the model API uses joblib. Version 2 uses pickle5.
