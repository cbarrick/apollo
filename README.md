# Solar Radiation Prediction

This repository contains code and notes for a project to predict solar radiation and energy production in Georgia.

## Contents
- `gaemn` - Experiments on the GAEMN15 dataset. These experiments are focused on getting a better understanding of how weather effects solar radiation. These are less important than the NAM experiments.
- `nam` - Experiments on the NAM dataset. These are the most important.
