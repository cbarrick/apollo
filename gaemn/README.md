# Experiments

This directory contains code and notes for experiments using the GAEMN15 dataset. These experiments are focused on getting a better understanding of how weather effects solar radiation. These are less important than the NAM experiments.


## Contents

- `core` - reusable utilities for running experiments.
- `data.gaemn15` - a loader class for the dataset.
- `experiments.exp1` - deltas and auxiliary predictions with random forrest.
- `experiments.exp2` - various timestamp features with random forrest.
- `experiments.exp3` - scaling with random forrest.
- `experiments.exp4` - model selection.
- `experiments.exp5` - feature selection.
- `experiments.exp6` - neural networks.
- `experiments.exp7` - cross site evaluation.
- `experiments.exp8` - hyper-parameter tuning.
