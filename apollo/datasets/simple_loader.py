"""
The simple_loader module provides high-level functions for loading cached data into in-memory numpy arrays

The loader expects a `cache_dir` argument, which specifies the directory where the NAM and Georgia Power data can be
found.  NAM forecasts generated from apollo.datasets.open should be located in the <cache_dir>/NAM-NMM directory.
There should be a single log file
