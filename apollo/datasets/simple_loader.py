    """Loads a dataset from on-disk GRIB files into an in-memory numpy array

    By default, loads weather forecast attributes from local grib files and joins them with the target values found in
    logs from Georgia Power.  Data should be cached (downloaded) in the cache_dir.
    NAM forecasts generated from apollo.datasets.open should be located in the <cache_dir>/NAM-NMM directory.
    There should be a single uncompressed log file located in the <cache_dir>/GA-POWER directory that has
    target readings from the solar array.

    This function can also be used to load plain NAM data (with no targets) by setting the `target_var` to None.

    All parameters are optional.

    Args:
        start (str): Specifies the reference time of the first data point to be selected.
            Any string accepted by the np.datetime64 constructor is acceptable.
        stop (str): Specifies the reference time of the last data point to be selected.  Any string accepted by
            the np.datetime64 constructor is acceptable.
        cache_dir (str): The local directory where the data can be found.  Should have subfolders 'NAM-NMM'
            containing NAM forecasts and 'GA-POWER' containing the data from the solar farm.
        standardize (bool): Should the data be standardized?
        desired_attributes (array or str): One-dimensional numpy array with the names of the data variables to select,
            or the keyword 'all' to select all data variables, or the keyword 'surface' to select surface variables.
        grid_size (int): The size of the spatial grid from which features will be selected.
            This parameter will be rounded up to the nearest odd integer, and a grid of shape (grid_size, grid_size)
            will be selected.
        target_var (str): Name of the reading from Georgia Power logs which will be used as the target.
        target_hour (int): Integer in the range [1, 36] specifying the target prediction hour

    Returns:
        A tuple (x, y), where where x is an n x m np.array containing the non-target attributes,
        and y is an n x 1 np.array containing the target values.

        If the target_var is None, then y will be None.
