def interval(year=None, month=None, day=None, hour=None, minute=None):
    '''Helper function to group a timeseries DataFrame by interval.

    Args:
        year (int): Group by rounding the year.
        month (int): Group by rounding the month.
        day (int): Group by rounding the day.
        hour (int): Group by rounding the hour.
        minute (int): Group by rounding the minute.

    Returns:
        Callable[[datetime.datetime or pandas.Timestamp], datetime.datetime]:
            A function that maps arbitrary datetimes to reference datetimes by
            rounding interval properties like `second` and `minute`. The input
            may be a :class:`datetime.datetime` from the standard library or a
            :class:`pandas.Timestamp`. The return value is a
            :class:`datetime.datetime`.

    Examples:
        Group a DataFrame into 15 minute blocks:
        >>> df.groupby(interval(minute=15))

    Warning:
        Getting the right arguments for the interval you want is subtle.
