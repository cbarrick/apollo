def interval(year=None, month=None, day=None, hour=None, minute=None):
    '''Group a timeseries DataFrame by interval.

    Example:
        Group a DataFrame into 15 minute blocks:
        >>> df.groupby(interval(minute=15))

    Gotchas:
        Getting the right arguments for the interval you want is subtle.
        Read the code to see exactly how this works.

    Args:
        year (int): Group by rounding the year.
        month (int): Group by rounding the month.
        day (int): Group by rounding the day.
        hour (int): Group by rounding the hour.
        minute (int): Group by rounding the minute.

    Returns:
        A function that maps arbitrary datetimes to reference datetimes by
        rounding interval properties like `second` and `minute`.
