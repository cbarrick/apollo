'''Universal accumulators.

This module provides accumulators like `Mean` which are universally useful.
These general accumulators all accept a `transform` function to apply to each
batch before accumulation. This is handy to compute a wide range of statistics.
For example, if you have a loss function called `loss`, you can create an
accumulator for mean loss with `Mean(loss)`.

class Sum(Accumulator):
    '''An accumulator for sums of data.

    Inputs to the accumulator are taken in batches. Each batch is first
    reduced, then the reduced values are added to a running total. This leads
    to three cases:

    1. If a given batch is a scaler, it is added to the accumulator directly.
    2. If a batch has a `sum` method, the batch is reduced using that method.
    3. Otherwise the batch is reduced using numpy's `np.sum` function.

    In the second and third cases, additional keyword arguments passed to the
    constructor are forwarded to either the `.sum` method call or `np.sum`
    function call on each batch. This allows e.g. summing along a specific
    axis.
