This directory holds HTML templates for producing web pages from apollo forecasts stored in JSON files. 
The general idea is that the data in each JSON forecast is combined with an HTML template to form a complete HTML page. 
An index page is also produced. Supporting JavaScript and CSS files are also stored here. 
When the HTML forecast files are created, it and the supporting files are copied to an output directory.
