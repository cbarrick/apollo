This directory contains data files that are used by certain Python routines. Contained are: 

* SQL scripts for creating empty databases of the appropriate format. 
* Templates for creating HTML files from forecast data. 
* csv files for creating JSON schemas files for use with data sources (these provide human readble names for variables, etc.)

These assets should be copied to $APOLLO_DATA/assets during installation.
